It's been a while since I've been playing with the idea in my head. Getting a membership at the local library.

Or wait, I didn't even know if there was a local library in existence. Of course, there must be one. After all, we're in Kochi!

The benefits of reading regularly has been explained over and over again on the internet multiple times before, and I'm not going to go over that here again. I used to be a voracious reader till a few years ago, when my academic schedules have started to leave me very little time for anything else.

However, now that I'm taking a break from my academics, I decided I might as well read.

Thanks to Google Maps, I discovered that there were a couple of libraries here in Aluva, but then the ratings were poor. However, in the city, in Ernakulam, there was this place called ['Ernakulam Public Library'](http://www.ernakulampubliclibrary.com/) that had considerably better ratings.

The next time I went to the city, I went ahead and got myself a membership &mdash; a Plan-B membership which means that I get to take two books at a time. And the membership fee was fair enough. The lion's share for the membership cost is the security deposit, which, I assume you'll get back when you cancel your membership.

The library, though several storeys high, isn't what I would call particularly big. It's apparently targeted at the various Arts and Science colleges in town.

There are several shelves full of English fiction, which is kind of what I wanted. It also has a big section on [auto]biographies. Read somewhere before that such books give insights into the lives of great men. However, I just couldn't find the one biographical work which I was really looking for -- Benjamin Franklin's biography written by Walter Issacson.

The library also has an online portal where I can login and renew my books, and reserve the books which I wish to read etc. The website itself seems rather neat -- way better than what my former college offered.

In addition, it maintains an [online catalog](http://122.165.117.71/) of all the books in the library, and includes useful information like whether or not the books are currently in the library, its shelf number and location etc. You don't have to log in to view the online catalog.
