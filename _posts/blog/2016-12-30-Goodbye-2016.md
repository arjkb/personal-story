2016 has been spectacular! My life has changed its course -- literally, towards the other side of the planet!

First and foremost, the primary event for the year is that I went to the United States as part of an exchange program and had a fabulous time there! Even after 7 months since I returned back to India, not a single day passes when I don't think about my days in America!

Besides being a generally interesting place, I also made new friends from multiple countries.

The education system there is substantially better and conductive to learning than anything else I've experienced back home in India. Academically, I have progressed in the amount of new knowledge that I've gained. Sure, the academic side was stresful as I was pushed way beyond my limits, but now I realize my limits have expanded and that I'm capable of much more than I ever thought I could be.

Living in the US has brought about positive change within me in terms of the way I think and how I deal with the challenges that come my way.

I returned back home towards the end of May. Although my initial plan (before I went to US) was to join for the Master's degree at Amrita (where I studied as an undergrad), I decided to apply instead to universities outside India. Two in the UK, and UNM in the United States. My preferred university was UNM as I was already familiar with the place.

TOEFL and GRE scores were required for applying to universities abroad, and I spent the next one month preparing for both tests. In this regard, I had already bought two official books by ETS from the United States.

Buying those books turned out to be a good thing; I got a feel of those tests beforehand -- the format, types of questions, and the general strategies to answer them. They minimized the element of surprise that might have surfaced on the actual test dates.

Immediately after those tests were over, I set about learning other things -- certain programming concepts, technologies, certain MOOCs etc. All through June to December, I would be spending my time learning something or the other.

In the meantime I had to do multiple back and forth trips to Amritapuri to get my marksheets sorted out. The grades I received from UNM had to be transferred to my gradesheet in Amrita.

Another wonderful thing that happened during the time was that we bought a brand new Mercedes-Benz E-Class! After pondering over the idea for several years, and we finally decided to take the plunge.

Having covered about 5000 kilometres with us till date, this German beauty has turned out to be a gem!

My convocation happened in August from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's Coimbatore campus. I was awarded a silver medal for my academic performance. Incase you're wondering, no, I'm not at all bothered about not getting the gold.

By September, my sister's wedding was fixed -- the groom is a doctor and was a former classmate of hers. Ahem!

The actual wedding date was set to December 25th. Before you roll your eyes, the date was fixed taking into consideration the conveniences of maximum number of people, along with things like availiability of wedding halls. We wanted to do it on a Sunday so that maximum people could attend the function without having to take a day off from work. Unfortunately, Christmas this year happened to be on a Sunday.

Weddings in India are a big deal, even in the south. From September to December we were running about to ensure that the wedding would actually turn out to be the big gala event we all hoped it would be. This included booking a wedding hall, getting the catering service, buying the stuff for *pooja*, decorating the hall and the stage, and also the photographers.

We soon realized that it would be difficult for us to manage everything on our own, and so we hired an event management company -- [Scenario Weddings](http://www.scenarioweddings.com) lead by Mr. Behanan. They do charge a premium, but they were very professional and it was well worth it.

While we were spending our time planning the wedding, my admission to UNM got confirmed. In addition to the minor paperwork I had to do, like providing proof of finances, I had to fly to Chennai for a couple of days to get my visa.

While I was on board my return flight from Chennai on November 8th, the Prime Minister of India Shri. Narendra Modi announced [demonetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation). The ups and downs of this move has been well debated over the media during the past 50 days, and I wish to talk about it no further.

My sister's wedding took place on December 25th as planned. The event was fabulous, and the guests were happy. Some of my friends from college were also present. It was a fun event.

So overall, even though I was at home for two-thirds of the year, it was a fun and eventful! *Loved it!*
