A new year has begun, and once again I have the chance to set my new-year resolutions.

 But I promise you, unlike the previous resolutions of the past several years this one is different, in that I have also thought about how exactly I'm going to execute on my resolutions.

I'll list out my resolutions up front.

* [Learn JS based web technologies](#i-learn-js-based-web-technologies)
* [Build my own portfolio website and host it on the internet.](#ii-build-and-host-my-own-portfolio-website)
* [Start earning money by writing code](#iii-start-earning-my-own-money)
* [Read six non-fiction books](#iv-read-six-non-fiction-books)
* [Contribute to Fedora](#v-contribute-to-fedora)
* [Learn Hindi](#vi-learn-hindi)

### I. Learn JS based Web Technologies
As an aspiring developer and a computer science student, it's hard not to notice JavaScript. The primary reason I haven't already started learning it was because I [don't really know where to start](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.5c1ssnglc). JS seems to have practically exploded within a span of a couple of years. There's lots and lots of new frameworks and stuff to get things done. It's scary.

Till now I've been working with other programming languages, such as Python. I've tried learning Django, and have found that it's highly confusing. And now that I realize I anyway have to put in tonnes of effort, I kind of realized that I might as well put in all that effort to learn JS and its associated frameworks.

And it's not just javascript that I want to learn. I wish to learn the whole thing -- front-end, back-end and everything in between, so that I'll be able to come up with a whole web application.

As of now, I think it'll be best if I start learning from FreeCodeCamp. The only tiny issue with FCC (and indeed most other platforms) is that those assume you know nothing about programming. and make you do all the lame stuff.

But I guess I'll endure. And besides, as I've noticed on the *map* in FCC, it's only the first fifty or so exercises that are kind of lame. The rest are interesting enough.

##### Execution plan
Work on the exercises in FCC during the free time I get when I go to college. The spring semester end in the middle of May, and I should have 3 months of break during the summer. Sounds like plenty of time.


### II. Build and host my own portfolio website
This one is basically an extension of the above. I plan to create my own website and stuff usign the technologies I learnt using JS. I think this would be useful in the future, when I'm done with my formal education and is hunting for a job.

Although I'm aware that several services exist for hosting our own website, I haven't actually done it myself. So, once I create the portfolio website, I plan to host it online. This way, I get to learn how to actaully host a website on the internet.

##### Execution Plan
By the end of June, I should've become more or less at ease with JavaScript and it's associated frameworks. Considering my fall semester would begin on mid-August, I've got roughly 45 days to get a website up and running. I also should've done some interesting projects using JS during my learning phase -- I'll show off those project on my portfolio page.

### III. Start earning my own money
Admit it or not, money is a necessity of life. Of course, I'd like to say that I work due to my passion and love for programming, but passion and love alone won't compensate for some of the financial necessities that programmers have. Like money to host my own website, for instance.

Of course, I do have the option of working at a gas station to make money, but no, that's not how I intend to do it.

Instead, I intend to do freelance programming jobs to other people. Now, I don't really know how to go about executing this. There are details I still need to work out, like for instance, figuring out whether it's even legal for me to do freelance work from certain countries.

Of course, I don't wish to earn something like $100,000 right away. I just need sufficient money to cover the costs of my programming work.

Another thing I could do is to compete in Google Summer of Code. They pay over $5000 to succesful applicants, which is quite good enough for my purposes.

### IV. Read six non-fiction books
Here's something that doesn't have anything to do with programming.

It is now a widely established fact that all great people in this work read extensively. The reading lists of Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates, amongst others, have been publicized online.

And it's a no-brainer. As you read more, you take into your brain all the ideas, insights, and perspectives of other people.

I don't know if 6 seems like a low number. Truth is, I used to be a voracious reader back when I was a small kid. I grew up reading the Harry Potter series, Famous Five, Nancy Drew and many others.

As I grew older, I got busier, and reading took a backseat. At the current read, I read a maximum of 1 or 2 books a year cover-to-cover, which is a pity. I intend to change that, and so I'm choosing a low-enough number (like 6) to begin with. I think I can manage one book per two months.

Though reading fiction is a really nice experience, I'm not fairly convinced that all the growtch lies in the non-fiction works, such as biographies, for instance. Gives an insight into the minds of great men; how they made the decisions that they did. For anyone who haven't tried biographies yet, I hightly recommend *Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson*.

Carrying around a lot of books is usually a pain, especially considering the fact that I'm an international traveller, and there are size and weight restrictions on the amount of luggage I can carry around with me. To get around this problem, I'm considering getting myself an e-book reader, such as an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. So far the reviews have been promising, and thought it isn't very common where I live, I had seen a demo-model at the Lulu-Connect store in Lulu Mall Kochi.

Though I spent only about a minute caressing the device, I would say I was impressed. Especially the typeface and the fact that it doesn't hurt your eyes like a typical tablet computer does.

And, though there's a hefty price to pay upfront in the case of an ebook reader, you can quickly recover the costs by purchasing the Kindle version of the books you intend to read, which is usually drastically cheaper than an actual physical copy of the book. Plus, you don't have to worry about carrying around all your bookshelf.

### V. Contribute to Fedora
This one is also a programming task. And this particular task is somehting I've been putting off for far too long.

Fedora is my favorite linux distro at the moment, and it has remained that was for well over a year now. And now, I would like to do my part in making it better. I think I'll start with packaging. As a matter of fact, there are a couple of softwares on GitHub which I wish to see on the Fedora repositories, so that I (and others) wouldn't have to bother with the intricacies of installing from the source. So maybe I'll try packaging those for Fedora and see how it goes.

In addition, I'm hoping that contributing to open-source projects (such as Fedora) is a great was to enhance my own skill-set and ability to work with existing codebase.

### VI. Learn Hindi
Something I should've done years ago.

Just in case you don't know, Hindi is one of the official languages of India, and is a widely spoken language here, especially in the northern region (and I'm from the south).

Though I don't normally have any reason to converse in Hindi (because I'm from the southern part of India where people don't normally converse in Hindi), I wish to learn this so that I can enjoy watching bollywood movies (where people speak in Hindi). As of now, I watch bollywood movies only if it has English subtitles. But then, I end up spending most of my time *reading* subtitles rather than actually *watching* the movie. And that's kind of annoying.

Recently, I was in Lulu PVR to watch *Dear Zindagi* starring SRK, and though there were subtitles initially, it stopped right after the interval. I was left guessing during the entire second half of the movie.

Sure, Hindi was part of my school-curriculum for a couple or more years, but then, I haven't learnt enough Hindi to converse. I know all the letters, and I even know the meaning of several words, but it is hard for me to join those words into meaningful sentences. And whenever I read or listen to something in Hindi, I'm extremely slow in processing what was being read (or said).

In the coming yeay, I intend to change all of that. As a matter of fact, I had tried taking a couple of lessions of a free online course in this regaard, and I instantly felt it to be infinitely better than how I'd been taught Hindi at school. In addition, there  mobile applications to aid in learning Hindi, which I intend to make good use of.
