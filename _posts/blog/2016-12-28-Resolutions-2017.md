A new year has begun, and he's my chance to set a list of all new resolutions (again). But I promise you, unlike last time this one might be different. And I'll tell you why by the end of this post.

I'll list out my resolutions up front.

1. Learn JS based web technologies
2. Builld my own portfolio website and host it on the internet.
3. Start earning money by writing code
4. Read six non-fiction books
5. Contribute to Fedora
6. Learn Hindi

### I. Learn JS Based Web technologies
As an aspiring developer and a computer science student, it's hard not to notice JavaScript. The primary reason I haven't already started learning it was because I didn't really know where to start. JS seems to have practically exploded within a span of a couple of years. There's lots and lots of new frameworks and stuff to get things done. It's scary.

Till now I've been working with other programming languages, such as Python. I've tried learning Django, and have found that it's highly confusing. And now that I realize I anyway have to put in tonnes of effort, I kind of realized that I might as well put in all that effort to learn JS and its associated frameworks.

And it's not just javascript that I want to learn. I wish to learn the whole thing -- front-end, back-end and everything in between, so that I'll be able to come up with a whole web application.

As of now, I think it'll be best if I start learning from FreeCodeCamp. The only tiny issue with FCC (and indeed most other platforms) is that those assume you know nothing about programming. and make you do all the lame stuff.

But I guess I'll endure. And besides, as I've noticed on the *map* in FCC, it's only the first fifty or so exercises that are kind of lame. The rest are interesting enough.

##### Execution plan
Work on the exercises in FCC during the free time I get when I go to college. The spring semester end in the middle of May, and I should have 3 months of break during the summer. Sounds like plenty of time.


### II. Build my own portfolio website and host it on the internet
This one is basically an extension of the above. I plan to create my own website and stuff usign the technologies I learnt using JS. I think this would be useful in the future, when I'm done with my formal education and is hunting for a job.

Although I'm aware that several services exist for hosting our own website, I haven't actually done it myself. So, once I create the portfolio website, I plan to host it online. This way, I get to learn how to actaully host a website on the internet.

##### Execution Plan
By the end of June, I should've become more or less at ease with JavaScript and it's associated frameworks. Considering my fall semester would begin on mid-August, I've got roughly 45 days to get a website up and running. I also should've done some interesting projects using JS during my learning phase -- I'll show off those project on my portfolio page.

### III. Start earning my own money
Admit it or not, money is a necessity of life. Of course, I'd like to say that I work due to my passion and love for programming, but passion and love alone won't compensate for some of the financial necessities that programmers have. Like money to host my own website, for instance.

Of course, I do have the option of working at a gas station to make money, but no, that's not how I intend to do it.

Instead, I intend to do freelance programming jobs to other people. Now, I don't really know how to go about executing this. There are details I still need to work out, like for instance, figuring out whether it's even legal for me to do freelance work from certain countries.

Of course, I don't wish to earn something like $100,000 right away. I just need sufficient money to cover the costs of my programming work.

Another thing I could do is to compete in Google Summer of Code. They pay over $5000 to succesful applicants, which is quite good enough for my purposes.

### IV. Read six non-fiction books
Here's something that doesn't have anything to do with programming.

It is now a widely established fact that all great people in this work read extensively. The reading lists of Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates, amongst others, have been publicized online.

And it's a no-brainer. As you read more, you take into your brain all the ideas, insights, and perspectives of other people.

I don't know if 6 seems like a low number. Truth is, I used to be a voracious reader back when I was a small kid. I grew up reading the Harry Potter series, Famous Five, Nancy Drew and many others.

As I grew older, I got busier, and reading took a backseat.

I intend to re-start my reading habit. In this regard I had even took a membership at the Ernakulam Public Library in my hometown in India.

Insted of fiction, I think I ought to focus on non-fiction. That's where all the real ideas are. Better yet, I should read the (auto)biographies of great people.

Carrying around a lot of books is usually a pain, especially considering the fact that I'm an international traveller, and there are size and weight restrictions on the amount of luggage I can carry around with me. To get around this problem, I'm considering getting myself an e-book reader, such as an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. So far the reviews have been promising, and thought it isn't very common where I live, I had seen a demo-model at the Lulu-Connect store in Lulu Mall Kochi.

Though I spent only about a minute caressing the device, I would say I was impressed. Especially the typeface and the fact that it doesn't hurt your eyes like a typical tablet computer does.
