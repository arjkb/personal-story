How the Kochi metro feels like
Interiors

Kochi metro was launched last week amidst much fanfare and ruckus. If there's anything the people of Kochi have waited forever for, it is the Kochi Metro.

I remember how the metro has progressed over the years. First it was the pillars, then the connections between the pillars, metro stations, trial runs etc. Hah.. I remember my friend Akhil mentioning to me back in freshman year that two pillars have been connected (it was the first time two pillars were connected by those "bridges"). That was back in late 2013.

Speaking of which, all the pillars of the metro are numbered consecutively. People have started using the numbers of pillars as identifiers ("Make a U-turn at pillar #50").

As is typical when anything big is launched in the city, there were good reasons to expect huge crowds at least in the initial few weeks. Same thing happened with the Lulu Mall, and same thing happened with T3 of Cochin International Airport.

Because of this very reason, I had zero plans to try out the metro anytime soon. However, it so happened that as we were driving back home from a trip to the airport, it was past 6:30 pm, and there were much less people around owing to the fact that an entire community had gone home to break their day-long fast. Opportunity never has to knock twice at my door.

And that's how it happened. My first ride in the Kochi metro. Let's cut the chase and dive straight in.

* The metro currently runs from Aluva to Palarivatom, and back.
* Once the metro is fully built, it'll run all the way to Petta, covering all the busiest roads and intersections across Kochi.
* Aluva and Palarivattom metro stations span multiple floors. Don't know about the other metro stations.
* Palarivattom station has 3 floors -- ground, first, and second. Trains come and go on the second floor. Tickets, entrance and exit to the streets etc are on the ground floor. *So what's in the first floor?*
* Perhaps I missed it, but I noticed only a single escalator between any two floors. For instance, at Palarivattom, there's an escalator going from 1st to 2nd floor, but none from 2nd to 1st floor. You do have the option of lifts if you wish to avoid the long flight of stairs.
* The sign-board on the platform that indicates the direction of train travel says "Towards Petta" rather than "Towards Palarivattom". Left me momentarily confused.
* The trip from Palarivattom to Aluva takes about 23 minutes. The same journey by road in rush-hour traffic would take over an hour.
* Travel time between any two consecutive stations is at most a minute or two.
* All sign-boards are clearly marked in Malayalam, English, and Hindi.
* Tickets are small, simple, and straightforward.
* Fares from every station to every other station is displayed on a chart at Aluva station. This chart probably exists in every station, but I'm not sure.
* Ticket fare from Aluva to Palarivattom -- the longest you can travel at the moment -- is Rs. 40 per person. Though expensive than a bus, the metro is much faster, safer, and is air-conditioned.
* A single trip can transport nearly a 1000 passengers.
* A ticket has to be used within 90 minutes of purchase.
* You can't buy return tickets from another station in advance.
* Your luggage will be scanned. The sort of thing that you see at airports. There's also a cop doing a body-scan using a metal detector. The whole procedure is quick.
* You've to pass through a small gate before you reach the platform. That gate opens only after the machine scans the barcode on your ticket. Reminds me of the excellent metro in Kuala Lumpur.
* You've to scan your ticket again after you get down at the destination station.
* There are official staff all around to guide you if you get confused.
* Display boards on the platform indicates the remaining minutes until a train arrives. It's accurate.
* People were scrambling to take selfies and photographs the moment they hopped onto the train. Simple pleasures of life!
* Display boards inside the coaches indicate the current station, upcoming stations, and previous stations.
* In addition, there's a vocal announcement of the upcoming station, and other important information. Announcements are in both Malayalam and English.
* Multiple USB charging ports are present across the cabin to charge your smartphones.
* The floor of the train had a noticeable amount of dust, coming from the footwear of people's shoes.
* Eating is forbidden inside the train.
* The train stops for less than a minute at most stations.

Our first ride in the metro was definitely fun.

The metro is apparently a huge success, and will definitely be useful to the vast majority of commuters and college students across the city. Once the metro has been fully developed, I can see it becoming the lifeline of this beautiful city.
