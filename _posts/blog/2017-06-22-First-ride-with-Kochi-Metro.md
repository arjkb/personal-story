Kochi metro was launched last week amidst much fanfare and ruckus.

If there's anything the people of Kochi have waited forever for, it is the Kochi Metro.

I remember how the metro has progressed over the years. First it was the pillars, then the connections between the pillars, metro stations, trial runs etc. Hah.. I remember my friend Akhil mentioning to me back in freshman year that the two pillars have been connected. That was back in 2013.

There were good reasons to expect huge crowds at least in the initial few weeks. That's the case when anything new and significant comes up in this city. It was the same with the Lulu Mall (and still is even today, years after it was launched), and perhaps to a slightly lesser extent, the new international terminal of Cochin International Airport.

I had no plans to try out the metro due to this very reason -- the crowd. However, it so happened that as we were returning home from a trip to the airport, it was around 6:30 pm and there was much less people around, owing to the fact that an entire community of people has gone home to break their day-long fast. This was an opportunity.

And so, we parked our car near Aluva metro station, and went inside.

The metro station is neat and well maintained. And the sign-boards for the directions are well marked. It didn't take long for us to find the ticket counter.

A small chart near the ticket counter indicates the fares from every station to every other station. The fare for the entire journey -- from Aluva to Palarivattom -- is Rs. 40. I don't know if that's supposed to be cheap or expensive. Although more expensive than a bus, my intuition tells me it's par for the course. And besides, unlike the regular buses that ply on our streets, the metro is air-conditioned and is faster. but perhaps it might be expensive for those intending to make use of it on a daily basis, such as students for instance.

Let's cut the chase and dive straight in.

* The metro currently runs from Aluva to Palarivattom, and back.
* Once the metro is fully built, it'll run all the way to Petta, covering all the busiest roads and intersections across Kochi.
* Aluva and Palarivattom metro stations span multiple floors. Don't know about the other metro stations.
* Palarivattom station has 3 floors -- ground, first, and second. Trains come and go on the second floor. Tickets, entrance and exit to the streets etc are on the ground floor. *So what's in the first floor?*
* Perhaps I missed it, but I noticed only a single escalator between any two floors. For instance, at Palarivattom, there's an escalator going from 1st to 2nd floor, but none from 2nd to 1st floor. You do have the option of lifts if you wish to avoid the long flight of stairs.
* The sign-board on the platform that indicates the direction of train travel says "Towards Petta" rather than "Towards Palarivattom". Left me momentarily confused.
* The trip from Palarivattom to Aluva takes about 23 minutes. The same journey by road in rush-hour traffic would take over an hour.
* All sign-boards are clearly marked in Malayalam, English, and Hindi.
* Tickets are small, simple, and straightforward.
* Fares from every station to every other station is displayed on a chart at Aluva station. This chart probably exists in every station, but I'm not sure.
* The ticket fare from Aluva to Palarivattom -- the longest you can travel at the moment -- is Rs. 40 per person.
* A ticket needs to be used within 90 minutes of purchasing it.
* You can't buy return tickets from another station in advance.
* Your luggage will be scanned. The sort of thing that you see at airports. There's also a cop doing a body-scan using a metal detector. The whole procedure is quick.
* You've to pass through a small gate before you reach the platform. That gate opens only after the machine scans the barcode on your ticket. Reminds me of the excellent metro in Kuala Lumpur.
* You've to scan your ticket again after you get down at the destination station.
* There are official staff all around to guide you if you get confused.
* Display boards on the platform indicates the remaining minutes until a train arrives. It's accurate.
* People -- me included -- were scrambling to take selfies and photographs the moment they hopped onto the train.
* Display boards inside the coaches indicate the current station, upcoming stations, and previous stations.
* In addition, there's a vocal announcement of the upcoming station, and other important information. The announcements are in both Malayalam and English.
* There are multiple charging ports for your smartphone inside every coach.
* The floor of the train had a noticeable amount of dust, coming from the footwear of people's shoes.
* Eating is forbidden inside the train.
* The train stops for less than a minute at most -- if not all -- stations.
