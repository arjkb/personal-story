[Kochi metro rail](https://kochimetro.org/) was launched last week amidst much fanfare and ruckus. If there's anything the people of Kochi have waited forever for, it's the Kochi metro.

I remember how the metro has progressed over the years. First the pillars, then the connections between the pillars, metro stations, trial runs etc. Hah.. I recall my friend Akhil mentioning to me back in freshman year that two pillars have been connected near Ernakulam North (this was the first time two pillars were connected by those "bridges"). That was back in late 2013.

Speaking of which, all the pillars of the metro are numbered consecutively. People have started using the number on those pillars as identifiers ("Make a U-turn at pillar #50").

There were good reasons to expect huge crowds at least in the initial few weeks. Same thing happened with the Lulu Mall, and same thing happened with T3 of Cochin International Airport. Typical when anything big is launched in the city. Because of this reason, I had zero plans to try out the metro anytime soon.

However, it so happened that as we were driving back home from a trip to the airport, it was past 6:30 pm, and there were much less people around owing to the fact that an entire community had gone home to break their day-long fast. This was opportunity banging at my door.

And that's how it happened. My first ride in the Kochi metro. Let me cut the chase and dive straight in.

1. The metro currently runs from Aluva to Palarivattom, and back.
2. A single trip can transport nearly a 1000 passengers.
3. Once the metro is fully built, it'll run all the way to Petta, covering major arterial routes across Kochi.
4. Aluva and Palarivattom metro stations span multiple floors. Likely the case with other metro stations as well.
5. Palarivattom station has 3 floors -- ground, first, and second. Trains come and go on the second floor. Tickets, entrance and exit to the streets etc are on the ground floor. *So what's in the first floor?*
6. Perhaps I missed it, but I noticed only a single escalator between any two floors. For instance, at Palarivattom, there's an escalator going up from 1st to 2nd floor but none going down from 2nd to 1st floor. You do have the option of lifts if you wish to avoid the flights of stairs.
7. Tickets are small, simple, and straightforward.
8. Tickets must be used within 90 minutes of purchase.
9. You can't buy return tickets from another station in advance.
10. Fares from every station to every other station is displayed on a chart at Aluva station. This chart probably exists in every station, but I have not confirmed this.
11. Ticket fare from Aluva to Palarivattom -- the longest you can travel at the moment -- is Rs. 40 per person. Though more expensive than a bus, the metro is faster, safer, and is air-conditioned.
12. All sign-boards are clearly marked in Malayalam, English, and Hindi.
13. At Aluva, the sign-board on the platform that indicates the direction of train travel says "Towards Petta" rather than "Towards Palarivattom". Left me momentarily confused.
14. There are official staff all around to guide you if you get confused.
15. Your luggage will be scanned. The sort of thing that you see at airports. Cops do your body-scan using a metal detector. The whole procedure is quick.
16. You've to pass through a small gate before you reach the platform. That gate opens only after the machine scans the barcode on your ticket. Reminds me of the excellent metro in Kuala Lumpur.
17. You've to scan your ticket again after you get down at the destination.
18. Display boards on the platform indicate the remaining minutes until a train arrives. It's accurate.
19. Display boards inside the coaches indicate the current station, upcoming stations, and a few other relevant information.
20. In addition, there's a vocal announcement of the upcoming station, and other important information. Announcements are in both Malayalam and English.
21. The trip from Palarivattom to Aluva takes approximately 23 minutes. The same journey by road in rush-hour traffic would take over an hour.
22. Travel time between any two consecutive stations is at most a minute or two.
23. The train stops for less than a minute at most stations.
24. Multiple USB charging ports are present across the cabin to charge your smartphones.
25. The floor of the train had a noticeable amount of dust, coming from the footwear of people's shoes. It remains to be seen how clean the metro will be in the long run.
26. Eating is forbidden inside the train.
27. People were scrambling to take selfies and photographs the moment they hopped onto the train. Simple pleasures of life!

The metro is apparently a huge success, and will definitely be useful to the vast majority of commuters and college students across the city. Once the metro has been fully developed, I can see it becoming the lifeline of this city.

The culture of the people of Kochi is also likely to change for the better. Certain old habits -- like writing on the walls of trains -- aren't allowed.
