*DISCLAIMER: I have no idea how much of what I saw in the museum is a fact. Read this article with a pinch of salt. And don't quote me on anything.*

I read a couple of months ago that there was a special exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History here in Albuquerque, and decided it would be a great idea to check it out today.

Of course, the museum showcased a bunch of interesting things, from dinosaurs, to rare gems. But the highlight however, was the aforementioned da Vinci exhibition. As a matter of fact, the da Vinci section was spread across multiple floors.

### Mona Lisa
Something that I've been curious about all my life is the [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa). In fact, one of the prime reasons I went to the whole exhibition was to learn as much as I can about Mona Lisa specifically. All these years, I never really understood why that particular painting has gathered the international acclaim it has. I believe beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but nevertheless I also believe there are better portraits of more beautiful women.

Turns out there's more to Mona Lisa than meets the eye. 

A mind-blowing surprise to me was that the whole portrait has been painted on over and over again! According to research scientist Pascal Cotte, there are entirely different portrats underneath what we see today as Mona Lisa. This was discovered by cutting-edge imaging technology (called "LAM" -- Layer Amplification Method) that has revealed the deeper layers of what lies underneath the surface.

I couldn't find an awful lot of information on the internet to substantiate what I have seen, but a couple of reasources I could find is over [here](http://www.lumiere-technology.com/Pages/News/news3.htm) and [here](http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/mona-lisa-discovery-scientist-finds-second-portrait-under-leonardo-da-vincis-masterpiece/news-story/ed9577ec0bbb154f22f0624882a0c4e9). The images shown in these links were on full display at the museum.

Also, I might be missing something, but I really can't fathom why artists back in the day would want to paint over an already existing portrait. Can't they just start over from a new blank canvas?!

And, as far as her beauty is concerned, I now think that the portrait is surprisingly detailed and rather realistic -- as in, real like a photograph -- especially when you see a really big version of the portrait. Keep in mind it's a 16th century paiting. Notice the smoothness of her hands, the individual strads of her hair, the subtle veil over her head.

I've never really been all that interested in art, but Mona Lisa has got me hooked. I now intend to check out the original Mona Lisa at the [Louvre Museum in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre).
