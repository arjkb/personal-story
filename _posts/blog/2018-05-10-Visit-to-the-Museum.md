*DISCLAIMER: I have no idea how much of what I saw in the museum is a fact. Read this article with a pinch of salt. And don't quote me on anything.*

I read a couple of months ago that there was a [special exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science](http://www.nmnaturalhistory.org/exhibits/temporary-exhibits/da-vinci-genius) here in Albuquerque, and decided to check it out.

Although the museum showcased a bunch of interesting things from dinosaurs to rare gems, the highlight was the aforementioned da Vinci exhibit.

### Mona Lisa
I've been curious about [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa) all my life. In fact, one big reason I went to the museum in the first place was to learn as much as I can about Mona Lisa. All these years, I could never comprehend why that particular painting has gathered the international acclaim it has. I believe beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I also believe there are better portraits of more beautiful women.

Turns out there's more to Mona Lisa than meets the eye. 

I was astonished to learn that the portrait has been painted on over and over again! According to research scientist Pascal Cotte, there are other portrats underneath what we see today as Mona Lisa. Cutting-edge imaging technology (called "LAM" -- Layer Amplification Method) has revealed the deeper layers of what lies beneath the surface of Mona Lisa.

I couldn't find an awful lot of information on the internet to substantiate what I have seen, but a couple of reasources I could find is over [here](http://www.lumiere-technology.com/Pages/News/news3.htm) and [here](http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/mona-lisa-discovery-scientist-finds-second-portrait-under-leonardo-da-vincis-masterpiece/news-story/ed9577ec0bbb154f22f0624882a0c4e9). The images shown in these links were on full display at the museum.

On a related note -- and this is probably a stupid thought -- I can't fathom why anybody would want to paint over an already existing portrait. Can't they start over on a blank canvas?!

After seeing the exhibits, I have changed my mind on her beauty. The portrait is surprisingly detailed and rather realistic -- as in, real like a photograph. Notice the smoothness of her hands, the individual strands of her hair, and the subtle veil over her head. Impressive for a 16th century work of art.

I was never interested in art, but Mona Lisa has got me hooked. I wish to one day visit the [Louvre Museum in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre) to see the original masterpiece.

### Da Vinci's Other Works
The exhibition wasn't all Mona Lisa; his other paintings were also on display, and some of them were fascinating, such as *John the Baptist.* 

Where I come from, da Vinci is best known as an artist. However, he was also a scientist/engineer, and replicas of some of his inventions were on display. It included the bicycle (some say he didn't come up with the bicycle), apparatus to lift heavy objects, apparatus for measuing distance travelled, and many others. Some of those replicas, such as a miniature model of the apparatus to lift heavy objects, had levers we could turn to understand how they worked.

### Dinosaur Bones
Turns out there are plenty of real dinosaur fossils here in New Mexico and in the United States in general. Pity I'm not as curious about them as I was 15 years ago.

This is the first time I'm seeing real dinosaur bones. One way to tell the replica from the real bone was to look out for the sticker next to the bone that says "Certified New Mexico Fossil".

### Planetarium
For those of you who don't know, a planetarium is a giant theatre-like room with a large dome-shaped roof. The seats are reclined such that you stare onto the roof by default. The roof is so big that's all you see. Projectors project videos onto this dome-shaped roof.

There were multiple planetarium shows throughout the day but you can visit only one of them with your ticket (I choose to visit one that the lady at the ticketing counter recommended).

The show started, and we were shown an image of the night-sky (today's sky!). A man with a mic -- our narrator for the show -- pointed out the position of the different stars, constellations, planets and the ways to identify them. To a corner of the screen, there was a small ticking digital clock that showed exactly what time of the night it was. The narrator has controls to make the time go faster or slower, so that he could show us how tomorrow morning's sky would look like if he wanted to. 

And it wasn't just the stars; he also zoomed into other galaxies in the universe, and showed us how they look like. It was a truly immersive experience. I've never seen anything like it before.

Overall, I had a great day. I wish I had visited museums more often back when I was a child. It definitely piques one's curiosity.
