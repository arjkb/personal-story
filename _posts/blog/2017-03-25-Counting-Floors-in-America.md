None of the forewarnings about the cultural differences of India and America had given me a heads up on the way floors are counted here.

And that's no surprise. I mean, counting floors is supposed to be trivial, right?! No!

The first few times when somebody said that a particular room or something is in a particular floor, I almost always went to the wrong floor...

And later I realized -- floors are counted in a different way in America!

So here's how it works. In America,

* The floor you walk into (the floor at the ground level) is called "first floor"
* The floor right above the first floor is the second floor
* And so on.

Except that in India (and in all the other Asian countries I've been to), floors are counted this way instead:

* The floor you walk into (the floor at the ground level) is called "ground floor"!
* The floor right above the "ground floor" is the first floor
* The floor above the first floor is the second floor
* And so on.

So everytime somebody says something is in the first floor, I walk into the building, climb up the stairs, and find myself in the Indian version of first floor (which is actually second floor in America)! *And then I'll have to climb down the stairs.*

*And on a much more global scale of things, I wonder what they mean when they claim things like "the [Willis Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower){:target="_blank_"} has 108 floors"!*
