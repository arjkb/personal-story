*I hate to rant. I fervently avoid it. But sometimes circumstances force you to!*

I'm one of those guys who prefer absolute quiet when studying. Noise tends to disturb my concentration.

Which is why I always study from the library. And I'm usually at its more quiet parts, like the carousels at the north-east corner on the second floor of the [Zimmerman library.](https://library.unm.edu/about/libraries/zim.php)

Except that sometimes, people do tend to talk in really loud voices, to the point that it is disturbing.

A couple of weeks ago, I was at the lounge in the [Santa Clara Hall](https://housing.unm.edu/residence-halls/santa-clara-hall.html), working on my computer when two young asian students walked into the room, sat on a sofa, and then began talking in the loudest voice humanely possible. Sure, people have every right in the world to talk from the lounge, but why talk in their loudest voice?! I'm pretty sure they didn't have to talk as loudly as they did!

Right now as I'm typing this article, I'm in the GPSA room in the first-floor of the Zimmerman library. There are currently two other groups in the room -- four girls conversing loudly in English, and three others conversing loudly in some language I don't understand. Till a few moments ago, there was one more guy in the room (who I suspect is north-Indian), but he walked out. Let me be positive and assume he walked out not because he was annoyed by the loudness in the room, but because he got hungry and went to get something to eat. Or maybe he had class.

Note that our library does have spaces where people are permitted to talk, and then there are other locations where everybody is expected to stay quiet.

Sad and ironical in a country where people generally tend to go to extreme lengths (in comparison to my home country) to display politeness. I definitely hear a lot more "thank-you"s and and see a lot more door-holdings here in America rather than in India. Yet, when it comes to basic things -- like, staying quiet in the library -- I'm thoroughly disappointed.

Having said that, I must say not all people are loud. There are infact a lot of people who show courtesy to other fellow students and whisper in soft voices when conversing in the library.
