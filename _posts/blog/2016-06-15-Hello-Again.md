This is my first post on this all-new website, built using Jekyll.

In this space, I intent to record the more interesting things that happen in my *personal* life.

There was a time when I was an avid blogger on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). However, as times moved forward, WordPress started to seem too unintuitive to my use case. Sure, it is a fantastic blogging platform, but I really didn't feel like blogging over there anymore; even when apparently "big" events happened in my life, like my moving to the United States, or returning back from there after completing my exchange-program, I just did not feel like blogging about it on WordPress; in this way, I have lost the records on several events that have happened in my life. And that's when I realized I wanted to move to a different platform. The WP interface was too bloated for my tastes. I wanted more control over a webpage and blog like a programmer (of course, you could argue that coding up a post is even more complicated, but then, that is the sort of thing I enjoy!).

Having said that, I would still say that WordPress is a fantastic platform and would recommend it to anyone who wishes to make an online presence. The folks over there are pretty fun too, providing useful tips and tricks to make blogging a more rich experience.

In either case, blogging through Jekyll seemed like the sort of thing I wanted to do, and what I would pretty-much enjoy doing. This platform gives me quite a lot of control every single aspect of this website. Plus, considering my recently found interest towards the web technologies, blogging on this platform can be a learning experience as well :)

[Medium](https://medium.com/) is pretty fantastic too in that it provides a clean experience. But then again, it too doesn't quite give me the total control that I'd like (however, given its clean interface, you really don't need all that control over the really finer details only programmers know how to mess around with).

Hope you enjoy this blog. *Happy reading!*
