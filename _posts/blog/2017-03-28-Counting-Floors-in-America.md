title: Counting Floors in America
excerpt: Cultural differences between something that's taken for granted.

None of the forewarnings about the cultural differences had given me a heads up on the way floors are counted here in America.

*Counting floors was supposed to be trivial! Something we take for granted.*

The first few times when somebody said that a particular room is on a particular floor, I almost always ended up going to the wrong floor. Eventually I realized — floors are counted in a different way in this part of the world! I’m from India by the way.

So here’s how it works. Assume there are no basements. In America,

* The floor you walk into (the floor at the ground level) is called "first floor"
* The floor right above the first floor is the second floor
* And so on.

Except that in India (and in all the other Asian countries I've been to), floors are counted this way instead:

* The floor you walk into (the floor at the ground level) is called "ground floor"!
* The floor right above the "ground floor" is the first floor
* The floor above the first floor is the second floor
* And so on.

Here's an illustration that clarifies how things work across cultures:

Even the elevators back home have a button marked “G” that takes you to the ground floor.

So every time somebody said something is on the first floor, I used to absentmindedly climb up the stairs, and find myself in the Indian version of the first floor (which is actually the “second floor” in America)! And then I’ll have to climb down the stairs.

*On a lighter note, I wonder what they really mean when they claim things like "the [Willis Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower){:target="_blank_"} has 108 floors"!*
