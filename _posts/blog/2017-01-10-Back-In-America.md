I'm delighted to let you know that I'm in the United States of America again.

This time, I'm here for my graduate program in computer science at the University of New Mexico.

I arrived earlier this afternoon. The weather is sunny, yet chilly -- hard for some people to think about. Like Rakhi for instance. If one ponders for a moment, it can be realized that the temperature in an area is not dependent on the amount of sunlight alone -- it is also dependent on other factors, such as the altitude from the sea-level, wind conditions etc. Come to think about it, the Mount Everest might probably get more sunlight than most other places in the world. I digress.

Speaking of which, I wasn't travelling alone. Amrita's exchange student to UNM this year -- a Ms. Rakhi from EEE -- was accompanying me. I know for a fact that this trip means a lot to her. And I'm happy that I had somebody to talk to during the 27-hour marathon journey from Cochin to Albuquerque. Don't know if she feels the sameway though; I wouldn't blame her if she has judged me as a lunatic from another planet.

Rakhi had already contacted a few Indian students in UNM, and a couple of them -- Gopi from Trivandrum and Meera from, I don't know -- had come to pick her up from the airport. Thye were the ones who dropped me off at the UNM campus (I initially planned on taking a taxi). Both Gopi and Meera are PhD students.

It feels strange to be back at UNM after a gap of 8 months. All the buildings and landmarks and everything look weirdly familiar, as if I was only here yesterday. Perhaps it could be due to the fact that during all of these 8 months, not a single day has passed by when I had not thought about UNM.

I did walk around the campus for a little bit and came across Amir from Iran -- a TA in one of the course I took in spring last year. Though he recognized me, I doubt whether it registered onto his head that I'm coming back here after 8 months, on a different study program.

I live on campus and has been put into the Santa Clara Hall, although personally, I was hoping for a room in Hokona where I stayed last spring. And I have a roommate. I mean, there's a bed and a shelf full of stuff, but I don't know whether he's currently on campus or whether he's at home for winter break. Most likely the latter judging by the way the dust has settled onto his things.

Although I would've preferred having a room all by myself, sharing the room with another student provides significantly more exposure, which is what I'm ultimately seeking here at UNM.

The check-in and the orientation sessions are scheduled to happen during the next two days. I also need to speak with my faculty advisor to discuss on my study plans for the master's degree.

La Posada isn't open yet, so for a couple of days I'll have to rely on stores off campus to get food. Speaking of which, I'm kind of hungry now and I think I'll go grab something to eat.
