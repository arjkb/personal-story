I'm delighted to let you know that I've come to the United States of America again.

This time, I'm here for my graduate program in computer science at the University of New Mexico.

I arrived earlier this afternoon. The weather is sunny, yet chilly -- hard for some people to think about. Like Rakhi for instance. If one ponders for a moment, it can be realized that the temperature in an area is not dependent on the amount of sunlight alone -- it is also dependent on other factors, such as the altitude from the sea-level, the wind conditions etc. Come to think about it, the Mount Everest might probably get more sunlight than most other places in the world, but I've no doubt it's pretty cold at the summit.

Speaking of which, I wasn't travelling alone. This time, I've had the company of a Ms. Rakhi Rajagopal, a fellow student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. She's Amrita's exchange student to UNM for this academic year. And I know for a fact that this trip means a lot to her. And I'm happy about the fact that I had somebody to talk to during the 27-hour marathon journey from Cochin to Albuquerque. Don't know if she feels the same about me though. I wouldn't blame her if she has judged me as a lunatic from another planer.

It feels kind of strange to be back at UNM after a gap of 8 months. All the buildings and landmarks and everything look weirdly familiar, as if I was only here yesterday. Perhaps it could also be due to the fact that during all of these 8 months, not a single day has passed by when I had not thought about UNM.

I did walk around the campus for a little bit and the only familiar person I've come in contact with is Amir -- he was a teaching assistant in one of the course I took back in spring last year. Though he recognized me, I doubt whether it registered onto his head that I'm coming back here after 8 months, on a different study program.

Though I preferred Hokona Hall -- where I stayed during spring 2016 -- I've been put into the Santa Clara Hall instead. And, I have a roommate. I mean, there's a bed and a shelf full of stuff, but I don't know whether he's currently on campus right now or whether he's at home for winter break. I'm inclined to deduce that he's at home for the winter break by the way the dust has settled onto his things. We'll see.

Although I wouldn't preferred having a room all by myself, sharing the room with another student -- an international student at that -- provides significantly more exposure. Ultimately, it's exposure that I'm seeking here in UNM.

The check-in and the orientation sessions are scheduled to happen during the rest of this week. I would also need to speak with my faculty advisor to discuss on how I'm going to get my master's degree.
