Just a short while ago, I finished reading [*Kane and Abel* written by Jeffrey Archer](http://a.co/hHRprre).

The novel had been on my reading list for quite sometime now. I was first made aware of it by a former friend back in the fall of 2008. Never imagined then that it would take nearly 10 years before I purchase a copy and read it.

The plot revolves around the feud among two powerful men in 20th century America -- William Lowell Kane, born into a wealthy family in Boston, and Abel Rosnovski, abandoned at birth in a forest in Poland and raised by a poor family. One has to admire Abel's unbelievable escape to America from the clutches of persecution and death, and his subsequent rise as one of the most successful businessman in 20th century.

Though it is a work of fiction, elements have been borrowed from contemporary world history, such as the sinking of the *Titanic*, the world wars, crash of '29, and multiple U.S. Presidential elections.

As mentioned before, the story revolves around the rivalry between these two men, which ultimately was based off of a lack of communication and stubborness on both their parts. In my personal opinion, the reason for their hatred is not strong enough and does not justify the decades it lasted.

The book is a true page-turner filled with suspense. I lost count of the number of times I was blown away by the plot twists! There was never a point where I felt bored.

In short, I -- a young adult in his 20s who hasn't begun to appreciate the classics just yet -- think Kane and Abel is an excellent novel.
