Just a short while ago, I finished reading *Kane and Abel* written by Jeffrey Archer. The novel had been on my reading list for quite sometime now.

I forget when was the last time I completely read a novel.

The plot revolves around the feud among two powerful men in 20th century America -- Willian Lowell Kane, born into a wealthy family, and Abel Rosnovski, abandoned in a forest in Poland and raised by a poor family.

Considering the very different backgrounds into which these two were born, one has to admire Abel's rise as one of the most succesful businessman in 20th century America.

The book is a true page-turner, filled with suspense and dramatic plot twists that would blow your mind.

Though it is a work of fiction, elements have been borrowed from contemporary world history, such as the sinking of the *Titanic*, the world wars, crash of '29, and multiple U.S. Presidential elections.
