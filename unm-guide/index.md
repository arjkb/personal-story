*An unofficial guide for Amrita students planning to study at UNM.*

First up, congratulations on being admitted to UNM!

I was an undergrad exchange student at UNM during Spring 2016, and I'm currenly in the CS Master's program at UNM.

I plan to maintain this as a living document at least until I graduate from UNM.

### Academics

Your academic experience here would depend on your area of study. I'm a CS guy, and I can only say things from a CS student's perspective.

UNM has an [online catalog](http://catalog.unm.edu/catalogs/2017-2018/) of all its courses that displays the course number, name, description, number of credits, and pre-requisites if any. Check it out (Google "unm catalog" or something).

Once all your paperwork is done and you're actually admitted into UNM, that's when you should register for classes. You do it online through a mechanism similar to [AUMS](https://www.amrita.edu/aums). Seats are limited for all courses, and the seats fill up quickly. Do not delay the registration if you wish to get into your preferred courses. Keep in mind that certain category of students get the opportunity to register earlier than certain other categories of students. For instance, grad students can register earlier than undergrads.

A course here typically has 3 credits. U.S. government rules (not UNM rules) stipulate the minimum number of credits international students must register for each semester. The last time I checked (please re-check!), it was:

1. 12 credits for international undergrad exchange students.
2. 9 credits for international grad students.
3. 6 credits for international grad students who are a TA or an RA.

"Grad" is the same thing as "postgraduate" in India.

Be forewarned: those 9 credits require a lot more work than 30 credits per sem' in Amrita!

You have to do a bit of homework before you register. Timings for certain classes clash with each other. You've to choose the classes such that none of them are at the same time.

After the classes start, if a subject is too tough for you to handle, you can drop that subject and register for another one. (You can do this within the first couple of weeks after the start of classes. You'll have to check on that).

Generally speaking, the courses are pretty good. "Good" does not necessarily translate to "easy" -- the courses are intense. By the time you take 4 subjects, you will be pretty loaded, and will have little free time. At least, that was the case with me.

For most courses, there will be lectures twice or thrice a week, and each lecture will usually be anywhere between 50 to 90 minutes long. Lab sessions will be in addition to the lectures.

Expect lots of assignments. These assignments alone will take up almost all your free time. The upside of blazing through these assignments is that you'll have an easier time on the actual tests. Sure you're going to have to study and really understand the material at hand, but once you do that then you will *usually* be able to score well.

Teachers are very helpful, and they would answer your questions candidly. Take advantage of their office hours to understand the material at hand.

The [libraries on campus](http://library.unm.edu/) are huge with [over 3 million books.](https://library.unm.edu/about/dean/3million.php) However, your prescribed textbooks would most likely not be in the library owing to reasons that are beyond the scope of this article.

Textbooks are expensive. Price of a new textbook can range anywhere between $20 and $200 (over Rs. 12000!). I recommend purchasing used textbooks; they are cheaper and quality is nearly as high as brand new books, with the binding and pages intact.

There are multiple ways to obtain textbooks:

* Purchase them through UNM Bookstore.
* Purchase them online through Amazon.
* Rent your textbooks; you pay less than the actual price of the book, but you'll have to return the book at the end of the semester. (And no, you don't get your money back).

You do have the option of purchasing used books from Amazon and UNM Bookstore (subject to availability). UNM Bookstore is located right next to the campus. You'll find your textbooks there  if the instructor for your course had requested it beforehand. They also sell a bunch of other items too, including stationery, UNM branded clothing and accessories, certain electronic gadgets etc. The bookstore sometimes offer buy-backs at the end of the semester; use this opportunity to recover part of your investment in textbooks.

### Accomodation
You can either choose to live on-campus or off-campus. I've always lived on-campus here because of the safety, security, and convenience it offers. Living off-campus might be cheaper.

If you choose to live on campus, you'll have to register on their [official website](https://housing.unm.edu) beforehand and make advance payment. "Hostels" in UNM are actually called "residence halls" (you don't say "hostel" in UNM). There are several halls to choose from, all with different number of roommates and amenities.

The rooms on campus are neat and clean. At a minimum, you get:

* Bed and Cot
* Desk with lockable drawer
* Chair
* Adequate shelves to store your things

You have to bring your own bedsheets, blankets, pillows etc.

Laundry facility is included. There are common washing-machines and dryers. Takes about 30 minutes to wash and 45 minutes to dry. Bathrooms aren't attached in all halls.

Check the [UNM Housing website](https://housing.unm.edu) for details of different types of rooms, their prices etc.

You also get a free mailbox -- a lockable box into which your mails arrive. Helps if you are going to buy stuff from Amazon or places like that. And besides, you need some sort of address before you can, say, start a bank account (if you plan to start one).

*And did I mention there's free WiFi everywhere on campus?*

### Food

Food is NOT included with the accommodation. You have to pay extra to get food on campus.

I assume you are not vegetarian.

There are several different places inside the campus where you'll get food. Some offer just coffee or drinks, some offer sandwiches, and some offer cuisine from around the world.

The major dining hall inside the campus is called 'La Posada' ("LaPo" in short). LaPo is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You get different types of predominantly non-vegetarian cuisine.

You'll have to pay upfront at the beginning of the semester if you wish to get food from LaPo. There are several different meal plans. The food you get for the different plans is the same; the difference is in the number of times a day and the number of days a week you could go in there.

I chose an unlimited plan -- I can go there all 7 days of the week and as many times a day as I want. For this particular plan, I paid $1950 for the whole semester.

The meal plan is applicable only for LaPo. You have to pay out of your own pocket to eat at other food outlets within the campus.

You can find information about food tariffs [here](http://lobocard.unm.edu/Dining-club-plans/meal-plans-2017-2018.html).

Now, I'm not crazy about food, so I was able to manage just fine. However, if you are a foodie or a vegetarian, perhaps you might want to consider other options.

Instead of choosing a meal plan, you could cook your own food. Get a room with a kitchen. Plan well and the money you save on the meal-plan would offset the higher rent of a room with kitchen.

### Life in Albuquerque

Albuquerque -- where UNM is located -- is among the largest cities in the state of New Mexico. It is not mighty large. I would say it is smaller than Bangalore. Perhaps comparable to Kochi, Kerala.

Though the town is relatively small, it has all the amenities you are going to need. Bus rides within the city is free for UNM students; to avail this facility, you need to get a particular sticker stuck onto your ID. You can get more information on that once you're here.

You could also make use of Uber for transportation within the city.

It is pretty cold during the winter. In January temperatures go well below 0&deg;C degrees at night and upto about 10&deg;C during the day. (Take a walk early in the morning, and you could see the small lakes and ponds frozen into ice. I'm not exaggerating).

Heaters are provided in all rooms so you won't have a problem indoors. But you're going to need multiple layers of clothing when stepping out. I recommend thermals, sweaters, a think jacket(s), and a thick jacket capable of widthstanding rain and snow.

It's pretty warm during the summer and fall; approximately between 18&deg;C to 30&deg;C.  

There are plenty of restaurants in the city. Even a couple of Indian restaurants where the food is good in my opinion. A decent meal usually costs between $8 and $20. Restaurants here tend to expect a tip, like around 30% of the bill. You don't have to tip if you don't want to. They're aware that international students are usually on a tight budget.

A coffee is between $2 and $5. You would inevitably end up drinking a lot of those 😉.

There are several shopping malls in Albuquerque.  

Your international friends on campus would tell you about a lot more places to go sight-seeing!

Albuquerque has it's own airport located about 10 minutes away from UNM. If you wish to travel to far-away places like New York City or San Francisco, you can fly on an airplane. Or, I heard there's a train to San Francisco.

### Visa

You need some type of student visa. The exact visa you need will be mentioned on the documents that you receive from UNM. It'll most likely be something called "F1 visa" (or J1 if you're coming on an exchange program).

Once you get the documents from UNM, apply for your visa; log in to the official U.S. govt. website and make an appointment with your nearest U.S. Consulate in India. Since I'm from Kerala, the nearest one for me was the U.S. Consulate in Chennai. There are U.S. Consulates in other cities as well.

The visa interview is a two-day process:

* Day 1 -- they take your photograph and fingerprints.
* Day 2 -- an actual interview with an American consular officer.

You have to make appointments for both these things, and it's best if you choose consecutive days for it (you can't do both on a single day, as far as I know).

Don't believe any horror stories other people tell you about visa interviews. Answer truthfully any questions they ask you, and you'll be fine. The consular officers were very friendly to me, and I had no trouble at all getting a visa.

There's a fee for the visa-application, which you pay online. I strongly recommend applying for the visa directly, instead of dealing with any middlemen or agencies.

The [Global Education Office (GEO)](http://geo.unm.edu/) at UNM handles all things related to international students. Check with them for accurate information and resources. 

I guess that's just about it. I hope you have a great time at UNM! Good luck!
